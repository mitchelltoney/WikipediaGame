## About the Project

The project is built off of the [WikipediaGame](https://github.com/alexhkurz/WikipediaGame) from alexhkurz. The goal of the project was to rework the method of finding links to be more efficient as well as optimizing the search algorithm more efficiently find a connection between the start and end page. The vast majority of the changes are located in `crawler.py`, although some small changes were made to the log output as well as javascript and html files.
